This section is just a brief introduction to the ensuing topics.  ~2 minutes.\n* ΄When Patterns Become Anti-patterns‘. This section will show how we unconsciously collapse our ap- plication structures by using design patterns to increase flexibility and let rigidity creep in to our designs.  ~5 minutes.\n* The Strategy Pattern. The Strategy pattern enables us to select algorithms at runtime, but this comes with at the cost of forcing classes to have knowledge about the contexts in which these algorithms are used. Focusing on the implementation of a commonly used pattern drives attention to- wards how we can implement the same pattern with different means, which will be one of the themes for the rest of the talk.\n* The Collapse of Application Structure. Our implementations of common design patterns causes a ΄pattern lock-in‘ that can fragment domain logic and blur out the distinction between domain and in- frastructure logic. This can hurt the maintainability of our applications.  Making Roles Explicit. This section will focus on improving the design of a domain model’s internals to achieve better separation of concerns and improved flexibility and maintainability.  ~15 minutes\n* Our Objects Play Too Many Roles. Our domain objects, especially Aggregates, often violate sound software engineering principles. The upside of this is that it gives developers using these a better experience, the downside is that it hurts maintainability.  In this section I will show how the common validation patterns we use in our models violates the single responsibility principle and eschew domain concepts.\n* Refactoring to Explicit Roles. In this section I will show how to separate the concerns in the previ- ous section into domain objects and services that adhere to the single responsibility principle and makes the solution more extensible.\n* Data Access is Infrastructure.  This section will focus on improving the architecture of an application by clearly distinguishing between domain logic and infrastructure code. Towards the end we connect the dots by combining the lessons from this section with the ones form the previous section.  ~20 minutes\n* Don’t Repeat Yourself! In domain driven design we use Repositories to abstract the data access layer. Different Repositories often share the same behavior and their implementations often violate the DRY principle. In this section I will show how to refactor the repository concepts into an application’s supporting infrastructure to increase productivity, reusability and maintainability without sacrificing the flexibility of hand-rolled repositories.\n* Lazy About Lazy Loading. Repositories are commonly used in conjunction with object/relational mappers to increase separation of concerns. As the real-world concerns of software development manifest themselves, these abstractions start to leak and soon our domain services get tainted with fetching strategies and similar. In this section I will show how we can combine the concepts from previous sections with Inversion of Control to keep our models clean.\n* Wrap up. In this section the emphasis is on separation of concerns, the DRY-principle and the importance of keeping roles explicit.  ~5 minutes\n\nh1.

These discussions resulted in a set of testing guidelines. The leaders of this task force started writing code to help implementing these guidelines. Unitils has emerged from concrete experience and lessons learned, with the ultimate goal of making unit testing easy, effective and maintainable. \nUnitils offers a lot of support in testing the database layer: automatic maintenance of test databases, automatic post-processing of the database to make it more test-friendly, loading test data using DbUnit and verifying the contents of the database after execution of a test. Unitils provides specific support for testing with JPA or hibernate, and offers integration with spring. It makes abstraction of the testing framework that is used for executing the tests, making it useable with JUnit3, JUnit4 or TestNG. \nBut Unitils is not limited to persistence layer testing only: The reflection assert utility is a very useful alternative to the classic assertEquals method with a range of leniency options. Unitils also provides superior support for dynamic mock objects, offering a simple syntax for specifying method behavior and verifying expectations.\nDuring this talk, I will present the different features of Unitils using simple, concrete examples. I will talk about problems from real projects and demonstrate how Unitils helps solving these problems.\n\nh1.

Summary\nWe'll start by talking about how you can thumb your nose at The Man by leaving out many of the main syntactic hallmarks of Java: semicolons, parentheses, return statements, type declarations (aka duck-typing), even try/catch blocks. Of course, there's no way that we'd leave metaprogramming out of the discussion...\n\nWhat is metaprogramming? We'll add new methods to classes at runtime -- even if they were originally implemented in Java; even if they were declared final. (Thanks, ExpandoMetaClass!) We'll call methods that don't exist and avoid the dreaded MethodNotFound Exception. (Thanks, invokeMethod!) We'll narrowly scope our metaprogramming shenanigans using Use blocks and Categories, and then cast our changes to the wind such that every instance of a class gets our added juice.\n\nIf you are happy taking the Blue Pill, this talk is not for you. You can continue using Groovy as a slimmed-down dialect of Java -- an \"After\" picture to Java's \"Before\". If, however, the Red Pill looks interesting, please join me. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.\n\nh1. Expected audience:\nThis session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers.\nExperience with other dynamic languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python will help, but certainly isn't required.\n\nh1. Required experience:\nYou should be comfortable with the basic syntactic rules of Java (so that we can mercilessly squash them). You should understand the basic \"Laws of Java\" when it comes to the semantics of a statically typed language (so that we can kick sand in its face). Most importantly, you should posses an open mind and a belly full of Dynamic-language KoolAid. This is not the forum for someone to vocally defend the merits of checked exceptions and static typing. You will be unceremoniously tossed out on your ear, Jerry Springer-style. Seriously. I'm not trying to convince you that this is the way you should write Java. The status quo can defend itself quite nicely, thank you very much. I'm here to show you how your code could look, if you so desire.

Summary\nWe'll look at the dramatic reduction in line of code you can achieve by simply flipping your POJOs to POGOs (Plain Old Groovy Objects). We'll talk about calling Java classes from Groovy, and calling Groovy classes from Java. We'll look at Groovyc, the integrated compiler that manages Groovy/Java dependencies without a hiccup.\n\nThere are wild-eyed radicals out there telling you that Java is dead, statically-typed languages are passe, and your skills are hopelessly out-of-date. Those extremists are the same ones who don't bat an eye at throwing out years of experience to learn a new language from scratch, pushing aside a familiar IDE for a new one, and deploying to a whole new set of production servers with little regard to legacy integration.\n\nWhile this \"burn the boats\" approach to software development might sound exciting to some folks, it's giving your manager the cold shakes right now. What if I told you that there was a way that you could integrate seamlessly with your legacy Java code, continue to use your trusty IDE and stable production servers, and yet take advantage of many of the exciting new dynamic language features that those fanatics keep prattling on about? You'd probably say, \"Groovy!\" I would, too...\n\nNot once will I tell you to throw out the old in favor of the new. In each case, I'll show you how to integrate the new with the old. Don't throw out your Ant build scripts; mix in a bit of Groovy to spice 'em up. Don't toss out your existing unit tests. (You are unit testing, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?) If not, Groovy is the perfect excuse to get started with a new language in way that improves the quality of your Java application without actually putting the new code into production. That is, until you get hooked on doing things the Groovy way...\n\nIf the Red Pill of Dynamic Languages scares the pants off of you (or your manager), don't worry about it. The Blue Pill still offers plenty of benefits. There is no other language on the JVM that offers you the level of deep Java compatibility such that you could rename your \"dot J-A-V-A\" files to \"dot G-R-O-O-V-Y\" and not skip a beat. Of course, they both end up with a \"dot C-L-A-S-S\" extension at the end of the day, so there's good chance that no one would ever be the wiser anyway. Groovy: funny name, serious software, and Java through-and-through.\n\nh1. Expected audience:\nThis session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers.\n\nh1. Required Experience:\nNothing more than standard Java knowledge.

Outline: \nThe quality of software can be divided into two parts. The first part is the outer\nquality, also known as functional quality. This is the quality seen by the user of the\nsoftware. The second part is the internal quality, also known as technical quality. This\nis the quality seen by the software engineers. The testing of software is often only\nbased on functional testing. Because the functional testing is driven by the functional\nrequirements, the functional quality is easy to test and easy to measure. The\ntechnical part of the software is almost ignored, because the technical quality is\nharder to test. But the technical quality directly affects the functional quality.\nSometimes you have non-functional requirements like response time for a certain\nfunction, but other non-functional requirements, like maintainability, are not\nmeasured.\nThe talk will give the attendees ideas how to “test” or measure the technical quality of\ntheir software. I will give answers concerning basic questions on software quality,\nsource code, object model, software metrics and their relationship. I will give a short\nintroduction into basic terms and I will give a short overview on basic metrics and\nmetrics on a higher, aggregated level. Then I will show some open source tools like\nPMD, ckjm, JDepend and will discuss the usage problems. Tools like SonarJ, Sonar\nand Xradar have more benefits. They consolidate the basic reports of the basic tools\nto create more readable and understandable reports of your software.\nThe talk will have a focus on practical methods. I will also give examples based on\ndaily project practice and the usage based on the open source tool XRadar\n(xradar.sourceforge.net).

Outline\n\nIn the past two years I presented the talks “The Top 10 Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application” and “The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application Scalability and Reliability”. Now that people have plenty of expertise on how to botch their applications, I wanted to shift focus from anti-patterns to patterns. The \"Top 10\" theme remains as it keeps a quick pace and enforces a quick distillation of complex topics into simple concepts for the audience to remember.\n\nIn this presentation I will use real world examples to demonstrate the challenges, solutions, and unexpected discoveries architects find when building scalable Java applications. I will site actual scenarios where each pattern has been used, and explain what the driving forces were behind these choices. (This talk consciously steers clear of discussing website scaling via content caching, as this is a topic well-covered by many whitepapers, presentations and other conferences.\n\nA few examples:\n\nFor example, working on an ultra-low-latency JavaSpaces-based trading application was one of our first exposures to Recovery-Oriented Computing (ROC) for transaction processing in a production environment. The ROC concept can be used to achieve otherwise impossible results by selectively persisting only critical system state. Prior to this, we had generally steered clear of non-replicated in-memory data. But applying the ROC concept allowed us to achieve an order-of-magnitude latency improvement over what even the most efficient replicated-memory approach would have allowed, without compromising system availability.\n\nLikewise, working with a high-volume clearing application, a partner discovered that while serializable database isolation was required from a business perspective, and their database of choice enforced this optimistically, performing initial locking in-memory minimized the number of transaction rollbacks, substantially increasing system throughput.\n\nMuch of this experience was acquired while working with customers in the usual early-adopter sectors: websites for retail, travel and hospitality; transaction processing and compute grids in investment banks; and more recently, the rush of so-called \"Web 2.0\" startups. While in most of these cases, the primary reason for being onsite with the customer was the Coherence product that I am involved with, many of the more interesting lessons came from working with 3rd party products from dozens of vendors and open source communities, and learning alternate solutions to common problems from the people involved with those products.\n\nh1.

Outline\n\nGroovy offers a great deal of flexibility in terms of concise and\nexpressive syntax, and through its dynamic nature. After an\n\nintroduction to the Groovy dynamic language, and  to the concepts\nof DSLs, their motivation, strenghts and weaknesses, Guillaume Laforge,\n\nproject lead of Groovy and spec lead of JSR-241 standardizing\nthe Groovy language, will guide you through the advanced Groovy\nconcepts that will help you create your own embedded DSL.

From this domain\nand its wealth of concepts, as software developers and architects, we\ncan derive a design that is aimed at solving problems encountered in\nthe day-to-day business. So far, we mostly solved these brainteasers\nwith computer science paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming,\nn-tier architectures, or with tools such as rules engines to stay\nclose to the domain at hand.\n\nIn this session, our goal will be to investigate how the paradigm of\nDomain-Specific Languages can be leveraged to help our teams build\nsolutions closer to our users' needs and requirements, and how it can\nprovide a viable, efficient and expressive alternative problem-solving\npattern. The technology of choice for enabling DSL solutions for your\nprojects will be Groovy, a dynamic language for the Java platform.","published":"true","title":"Writing Domain-Specific Languages with Groovy","slug":"writing_domainspecific_languages"},{"keywords":["Core"],"conferenceId":"5e130372-285d-49cd-aedb-7f306d97b04d","speakers":[{"name":"Jevgeni Kabanov","bio":"\nJevgeni has been the R&D lead of the largest custom software development company in the Baltics (Webmedia, Ltd) for the last five years.
