In my last year of high school I set up my own web server on a derelict computer I had lying around, and used it as a testing ground for a bunch of PHP stuff, which is where I've got most of my web development experience. \nDuring my first year of high school I started development of the Carmageddon mod Switcher (simply known as Carmageddon Mod) for GTAIV. I initially wrote the damn thing in VBScript, as stupid as I was, without any knowledge of object-oriented programming. As such, it was a mess, and I soon wanted to actually give it a proper interface. I force myself to understand how OOP works (which took quite some time), and soon enough I had settled on writing the switcher in Python with Qt as the UI. It is about half-way complete, and it is my only source of Python experience (although I can say for sure that I've learned <strong>a lot</strong>).</p>","age":"24","creation_date":"1353729400.243","last_access_date":"1496932092.46","location":"Oslo, Norway","reputation":"129","up_votes":"31","down_votes":"6","views":"10","profile_image_url":"","website_url":"http://giphtbase.org/"}

{"id":"2351721","display_name":"sarahjadesigns","about_me":"<p>You know the expression \"to come full circle\"? To have started as one thing, then evolved and afterward come all the way back to the beginning? I feel like I started to go around one and then jumped off the outside line into the center of it. There's a little bit of everything in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>Before I knew which direction I wanted to go, I was always very artistic. I was good at drawing, painting and just generally being crafty. While fun, I knew that realistically, being an artist wasn't something that would pay my bills. I knew that I was good at writing too, so why not try that? I started placing myself into positions to help this seed grow.</p>\n\n<p>It was joining the team for my school's paper that really put the spark in me. While I liked the writing, it was laying out the pages for each issue that made me realize I could make a living by being creative.</p>\n\n<p>I had a lot of fun in my graphic design program. I did a number of small jobs afterwards and eventually came to a place where my other skills resurfaced as well. I'm now both writing and doing design work. I like it a lot because I feel like I get to create a whole which works well together. I'm not just fitting a square peg into a round hole.</p>\n\n<p>I like the challenge. With the work I do, I'm sending a message - both verbally and visually. I like helping people, and I'm essentially working to convey something to them in the most clear and concise way as possible. It makes me feel good to see the results.</p>\n\n<p>And that's why I say it's like I jumped into the middle of the circle. I didn't go around and come back to the same thing, but I've meshed a couple of things I found along the way. I've learned a lot about myself and how I work while doing so and I hope that this won't ever stop.</p>\n\n<p>My goal right now is to learn more about the marketing aspects of what I do. This area of communication is one that fascinates me and I believe that finding out more about how it works will help me better convey my ideas. I like being faced with obstacles and coming up with solutions for them. It keeps stimulated and keeps me going.</p>","age":"32","creation_date":"1367751337.793","last_access_date":"1489134900.347","location":"Bergen, Norway","reputation":"46","up_votes":"3","down_votes":"0","views":"30","profile_image_url":"","website_url":"http://www.lucky-stars.ca/portfolio"}

{"id":"5792424","display_name":"ojnord","about_me":"<p>Finally getting serious about coding. As part of my self-development plan, I have put coding right on top of the list. Having earned an MBA years ago, I use this \"time-between-jobs\" to really try to get coding under my skin, so I joined FreeCodeCamp.com - and have come a long way allready.</p>\n\n<p>Previous coding experience? Well, I hard-coded what might have been one of the first web-ads in Norway years ago, for Honda cars at tu.no - the Norwegian technical union's magazine. This was in the late 90-ies mind, so I was early. I used .net framework to set up the full course management system at delfinen.no - Norway's biggest private swim- and lifesaving school. It still works today, reliantly and securely! Besides I have put up a few wordpress blogs, both paid and private. </p>\n\n<p>Professionally I have worked in marketing for some major global companies like Massey Ferguson / Eikmaskin, Thorn Norge rental and financing business, as well as in the oil and mobile industries. I believe my vaste business experience combined with my present thourough coding education might give me a professional edge in the coming years. Time will tell..</p>\n\n<p>I speak English, Scandinavian and Italian fluently, as well as working knowledge of German and now painstakingly learning French.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers, and please don't hesitate to contact me!

I came to this site to help build my website about baseball. People call me by two nicknames, Pauly, and PC Jackson. I was a star athlete in college but an injured leg got me out for my final year at college. I currently work on building computers, and microbiology. I have two kids and a beautiful wife. MY oldest kid, Pauly Jr., likes to play baseball like me. While my little princess Isabella age 12, is the toughest girl I know. She plays football, boys lacrosse, jujistu, baseball, and soccer. No guys or girls want to mess with her. My wife Alleigh Madision, is just a sweetheart. I look forward to getting to know some of you guys as you guys. I lived in Maryland, Myrtle Beach South Carolina, but then we went on vacation. We went to Norway to see the thirty days of night, and ended up viewing 20 days of northern lights. My daughter thought it was so beautiful we decided to live there. We moved right on the edge of Troms County, in Troms Fylke, Norway. We know own a big computer shop in the bigger cities, like Tromoso.

This will be the identification, payment and service infrastructure for other Telenor businesses, globally.</p>\n\n<p>I am very interested in team dynamics and productivity. I have been working on introducing agile software development and improved development process within my teams. I think that there are three key behaviors that really help with building quality systems: code reviews, unit tests and consistent style.</p>\n\n<p>My primary focus is on architectures, tools and techniques for enabling intelligent distributed interaction within and between teams of robots and humans. For my Master's degree, I created a distributed field robot architecture that built on standard hybrid reactive-deliberative robot design practices, but incorporated aspects of distributed computing by integrating a distributed middleware. We validated the architecture while completing a demonstration for the Office of Naval Research simulating a mine detection scenario with outdoor ground and aerial vehicles wirelessly connected to an operator control station.</p>\n\n<p>For my PhD I investigated several areas related to naturalistic taskability of teams of robots. We took inspiration from human society and the social constructs that allow us to operate in a wide variety of different situations throughout a given day. I drew from the use of social roles and extending this role concept to artificial robot social systems.</p>\n\n<p>While my PhD work was heavily geared towards robotics, this same concept could be applied to software agents and virtual internet societies.</p>\n\n<p>Specialties: robotics, artificial intelligence, java, jini, software engineering, agile development, robot-assisted urban search and rescue, machine learning, data mining, research, marine safety, oil-spill detection</p>","age":"41","creation_date":"1318502026.703","last_access_date":"1491483537.943","location":"Trondheim, Norway","reputation":"302","up_votes":"3","down_votes":"0","views":"14","profile_image_url":"","website_url":""}

{"id":"603083","display_name":"Benny Thomas","about_me":"<p>I'm on the path of constantly learning.</p>\n\n<p>I have used many variants of programming languages. My major was in algorithms at the college I attended.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently using JavaScript (<a href=\"http://nodejs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">node.js</a> and client-side: <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery</a>, <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">backbone.js</a>, <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angular.JS</a> and <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bootstrap</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ASP.NET</a>. I have done some <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">python</a> since 2013.</p>\n\n<p>In my earlier years I was into C++. I was sidetracked from that path 12 years ago. This because I was hired for a long lasting project. In that project they only was using <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2x7h1hfk%28v=vs.100%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">VB.NET</a>/<a href=\"http://www.asp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ASP.NET</a>/<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms711472%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSMQ</a>. I was able to sneak in some C++ in that project, but when I left the project I had to rewrite that part of the solution to <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">C#</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now seems that I can't get back on that path again. There are not many projects I know about that are using C++ nowadays. It seems that C++ is almost forgotten. For my part it might be the best as I think I almost have forgotten the most of the language.</p>","age":"50","creation_date":"1296819978.387","last_access_date":"1496738679.537","location":"Flekkefjord, Norway","reputation":"101","up_votes":"19","down_votes":"0","views":"21","profile_image_url":"","website_url":"https://twitter.com/virtueme"}
